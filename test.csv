"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes	Alain Connes is one of the leading specialists on operator algebras.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes	In his early work on von Neumann algebras in the 1970s", he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective factors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes	Following this he made contributions in operator K-theory and index theory", which culminated in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes	Baum-Connes conjecture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes	He also introduced cyclic cohomology in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of noncommutative differential geometry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes	Connes has applied his work in areas of mathematics and theoretical physics", including number theory, differential geometry and particle physics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes	Awards and honours",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes	Connes was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982", the Crafoord Prize in 2001 and the gold medal of the CNRS in 2004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes	He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences and several foreign academies and societies", including the Danish Academy of Sciences, Norwegian Academy of Sciences, Russian Academy of Sciences, and US National Academy of Sciences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	An astronomer is a scientist who studies celestial bodies such as planets", stars and galaxies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Historically", astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky, while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Today"," that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms "" astronomer "" and "" astrophysicist "" are interchangeable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a PhD in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	They spend the majority of their time working on research", although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	The number of professional astronomers in the United States is actually quite small.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	The American Astronomical Society", which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 7,700 members.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics", geology, and engineering, whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	The International Astronomical Union comprises almost 10",145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	While the number of professional astronomers worldwide is not much larger than the population of a small town", there is a huge community of amateur astronomers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties in their communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	The Astronomical Society of the Pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world", comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Like any hobby", most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	However"," amateurs span the range from so-called "" armchair astronomers "" to the very ambitious", who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Modern astronomers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night", it is very rare for a modern professional astronomer to use an eyepiece on a larger telescope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	It is far more common to use a charge-coupled device camera to record a long", deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Before CCDs", photographic plates were a common method of observation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes-most spend a few weeks per year observing", and the rest of their time reducing the data (changing it from raw data to processed images) and analyzing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Many astronomers work entirely from astronomical survey or space observatory data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer	Others work with radio telescopes like the Very Large Array", which is entirely automated, although it is maintained by telescope operators.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
